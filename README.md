# f-datas
This project is a first personal website for a professional Data Scientist and my first website as a frontend designer.
I wrote all html and css by myself and I used a .js library for the particles effect and I wrote my first .js with an scroll animation for the cards in Education Section.
I used my recent knoledge in UX Design and I supported the UI with Figma to develop a high-fidelity prototype that my client approved and next I built the website.
